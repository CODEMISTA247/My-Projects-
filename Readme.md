# Hello Coding World, my name is Cody Deseignora!
 
- I love tech so I decided to get back into software development after dropping the major back in college.
 
- Some of my Interests are:
 
* Producing music. Listening to music.  
 

* Grilling(This actually should of been at the top of the list LOL)
 
* Playing video games;My form of stress relief.
 
* Camping
 
* Interior Decorating
 
* Automobiles. Specifically the classics and Pick Up trucks.
 
* Last but not least, Coding. My new found joy,
    back in college I tried the major and gave up.
        I realised my attention span back in the days was much shorter than now.
        I'm excited for what's to come, my goal is to really dig deep into my soul throughout this entire course and journey to being a successful Software Developer.
